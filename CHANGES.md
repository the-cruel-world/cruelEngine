# CHANGE LOG

* Got Stuck in `Cross dependency & circular reference`
* Rename the engine to cruelEngine

* Engine Structure | Design Pattern
   - [ ] The code structure needs to be redesigned. Vulkan Samples of KhronosGroup has a nice one.
   - [ ] [a simple triangle](https://github.com/MarcelBraghetto/a-simple-triangle) is much better.
   - [x] Vulkan Render context
   - [ ] General Render Context
   - [ ] Scene and Objects
      - [ ] Texture
      - [ ] Mesh
      - [ ] Vertex
   - [x] buffer class / uniform buffer class / descriptor pool class / descriptor set (Layout) class


* Add Examples
   - [x] hello triangle
   - [x] draw indexed triangle
   - [x] uniform buffer
   - [x] bind texture
   - [x] triangle redux
